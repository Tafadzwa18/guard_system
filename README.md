# Guard Patrolling System (Django)

## What the system should do 
### Core Idea 
Admin creates sites, routes, and checkpoints.
Guard do patrols by checking in at checkpoints (manual codes/QR).
System tracks who patrolled, when, where and missed points.
Supervisor see a live dashboard 

### What it should feel like:
Start Patrol -> Clear/instant feedback 
Big buttons, minimal steps
Clear status (On time/Late/Missed)
Incident report
